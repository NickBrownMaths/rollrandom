    "Arachnus Phylarkus": "This delicate mushroom looks like a small black bowl with thin brown gills about 10cm across. It is poisonous to simply ingest but when steeped in boiling water for 10 minutes a thin black tea is created. This tea when consumed grants the drinker resist poison and disease for 4 hours. The mushroom is often the home of a particularly venomous type of spider and is difficult to harvest.",
    "Terra Mirabilis Boletus": "When ingested, this mushroom produces an effect similar to a Reduce Person or Enlarge Person spell. The effect is limited to three rounds. The effect produced is determined by where one bites the mushroom. That is to say, one side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter. The difficulty is determining which side is which, or even where a side begins and ends on a perfectly round object. Eating the entire mushroom will produce either effect randomly for 1d10 rounds.",
    "Fyngum Stinkulus": "This small aquamarine colored mushroom emits a foul smell when crushed. It can be used to overwhelm the senses, cover your scent, prank your friends, or can be distilled into a throw-able stink bomb. (Note, is also know to be a powerful goblin attractant)",

    "Profundus Obscurus": "(The Deceiver) This average brown and purplish mushroom ranges in size, features, and color. No two alchemists can agree on exactly how to classify it, or if they are even discussing the same mushroom. Implicated in untold arguments and altercations throughout history, it wasn't until the Great Debate of the Late Dyvonian Council nearly ended in bloodshed, that David Orelchy pointed out the mushroom exhibited the same energies as the spell \"Confusion\"When contained in a glass bottle the spores are contained and it can be thrown as a ranged weapon. The affect is 2 d12 wide and lasts for 4 turns unless there is a stiff wind.",
    "Enchantrynium Blistarix": "Wizards Bane mushroom This large, blue, tall-stalked mushroom gives its consumer a resistance to magical damage for 1 hour, but the consumer must make a DC 15 constitution save after that hour or take 1d4 poison damage.

Bride's Veils become almost completely transparent in moonlight, and grow at the edges of thick forests.The skirts, though extremely fragile, can be woven together into fabric using a precise hand(though very few have been known to possess the talent) for qualities similar to a cloak of invisibility.When brewed into a tea or liquid, the consumer experiences the effects of Invisibility for 1d4 hours.",
    "Pleurotus Androgenomyces": "A small, dark blue mushroom that grows in clusters of three. It particularly prefers soil that has been soaked in fermented beverages like beer, ale, mead etc... Commonly seen outside of pubs in warmer climates. When consumed fresh it transforms the imbiber into the opposite gender for 1d4 hours and increases Charisma by 1d6 for the entire duration of effect. For this quality it is colloquially known as the \"False Whores Cap\"due to the tendency of poor drunkards to impulsively eat them in order to sell their newfound bodies to bar patrons in order to afford more alcohol.",
    "Visus Invisibilia": "A small, rare, clear transparent mushroom with a milky substance seen throughout the bowl. It grants the person that eats the fungus the ability to see invisible creatures/objects for 4 hours.

    "Tricholgossum Falfortinem and Trichoglossum Fortinem": "Two outwardly identical small fungi that resemble miniature black catstongues. The T. Fortinem will give those who consume it whole a berserker rage, for 10 minus Con. modifier rounds. After the rage fades, those that consume must make a Con 10 save or gain 1 rank of exhaustion. The T. Falfortinem will give those that consume it a euphoria and a feeling of invincibility. Con 15 save on success, grants resistance to bludgeoning and piercing for 10 minus Con. modifier rounds.

These hallucinations often involve being attacked by a large dragon of the same type as the consumed mushroom.",
    "Yarokol Plenenium": "a small off-white mushroom with a blue-green glow. This mushroom strangely requires a drop of blood to cultivate. When ingested this fungus tastes almost uncannily of meat. The ingester suffers a disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws made to resist enchantment spells cast by the provider of the drop of blood for 2d4 days while the mushroom passes through their system. The effect may be ended early with a greater restoration spell. In addition, while affected by the mushroom, the provider of the drop of blood may cast enchantment spells on the consumer from any distance, if the provider knows where the consumer is. Drow mages have been known to use these mushrooms in a hearty version of a famous lizard egg stew called Nildax Godeneld.",

This enormous mushroom stands at 2-4 feet tall and can grow on trees, rocks or on most ground surfaces. This mushroom has gills but produces spores in a different way. The bubble pod at the top of the stem is about 1 foot wide and when broken or pierced in any way releases a silver-blue cloud of spores that latch onto all surrounding objects. Within 6 hours the spores sprout new fungus that begin to grow and anything they touch. When exposed to spores of this mushroom fall on a living host they will be paralyzed within 6 hours as the mushroom begins to grow. Within 72 hours, without medical assistance, the fungus will spread thin filaments into vital organs and slowly kill its host. Death Cloud patches often obscure bone piles and desiccated husks of their former hosts.",
    "Unguisi Aquilia or Eagles Claw mushroom": "This plain brown mushroom is about 6 cm high and can be distinguished by the large white dots on its gills and stem. Found around the base of very tall trees, Unguisi Aquilia does not appear to have any special properties and is often collected by travelers for a quick supper. However, experienced mages and mushroom hunters know that within minutes of consuming this delicious mushroom humanoids grow wings and large talons on their feet, often destroying clothing and armor in the process. Mages or others who are prepared before they consume this mushroom gain the ability to fly for up to 2 hours and also gain a sweeping talon strike that does 2 d6 of piercing damage. Tales of fireballs raining from the sky are often considered signs of dragon activity when in fact this curios little brown mushroom might be to blame.",
    "Psathyrella Aquatica": "This mushroom can be found in rivers, lakes, and other waterways. It is small and silvery blue with white spots on it's cap. When consumed Psathyrella Aquatica gives the ability to breathe underwater for 1d4 hours.

    "Magilicus Tempesti or Storm Mushroom": "is a relatively large turquoise mushroom that can change weather with release of spoors often using this ability to dampen its environment and call forth small storm when in danger. When disturbed the mushroom releases spores in an upward cone that do 1d6 necrotic damage upon exposure. A small magical lightning storm is formed in a 40' circle around the mushroom for 1d8 rounds and all creatures who fail their saving throws take 1d4 lightning damage per round while under the cloud.",
    "Myconis Lacusti": "A large black semi-rectangular fungus that often resembles a block of stone. When disturbed it teleports whatever is touching it into a demi-plane consisting of a small room with mushy walls. This plane will only transport its contents back to the mushroom if it is burned. The contents of the demi-plane take 1d6 damage as they teleport back.",
    "Proturbatis Fraudibus": "(the Joke Cap) A red mushroom about 2 feet in height with a thick cap. This mushroom was genetically altered by a necromancer long ago to tap into the dead souls of comedic bards. When disturbed the \"Fun-Guy\"reveals a human mouth and spouts a stream of one-liners in common that either antagonize or fascinate the listener but in either case they gain a bonus 1d6 bonus to perception. If anything touches the mushroom however it releases spores in a 20' cloud that incite spontaneous laughter incapacitating those exposed for 1d4 rounds.",
    "Boletus Aurumni": "This tiny golden mushroom is harmless to touch and delicious to eat raw giving its consumer a 1d6 bonus to constitution for 10 hours.

    "Exspiravit Bosletavi": "A pale white mushroom that sheds a phantom silver glimmer in darkness. Said to grow where a man with unfinished business died, it’s often found in graveyards and ancient tombs. If properly dried for 24 hours the consumer will be able to cast once speak with the dead. With a failed CON save (CD 10) they will have hallucinations of dead people talking to them. It is said that these hallucinations represent the spirits of the corpses buried under the mushroom even though this is clearly nonsense born from popular superstitions there are rumors of people who found ancient treasures a long time forgotten by following the instructions of this “spirits”. All legends have a seed of truth maybe...",
    "Fortuna Fortinaticus": "is a rather normal looking small brown mushroom with green gills that grows mainly in small rings or clusters out of dragon droppings. Coveted for their properties people have attempted to cultivate them for thousands of years to no avail. When one mushroom is consumed all dice roll results automatically get +3 for 1 hour (that is +3 to each die) but consumption of more mushrooms does not increase the bonus at all. At the end of the hour the consumer falls into a deep sleep for 2 hours and no amount of magic or physical prodding can wake them from it.",
    "Champinguini Fumenticatus": "Known as the Smoke Ball mushroom, this large fungus has a fat purple stem that is capped with round yellow globes of thin fragile membrane. The contents of the globules are a smoky blue mist that twists and twines around itself. Any movement or object that causes a globe to break releases the mist which flashes out into a 10' cloud as if under pressure. Contact with the mist results in instant paralysis unless a CON saving throw is made. This saving throw must be made each round for 1d10 rounds to see if a PC/NPC/Monster is still paralyzed or re-paralyzed. With a successful DEX roll a skillful adventurer who finds this mushroom can extract the globe into a glass or other throw-able container for future use. If someone who is carrying these globes trips, falls, is pushed, leans on, or breaks the globes in any way they should hope that nobody is standing too near to them.",
    "Celeritis Maximus": "Known as Blur Root grows mostly underground and in the Underdark. It is a curious fungus that avoids light and often grows in very dark conditions with just the small cap peeking out of the ground or leaf cover. The cap is small, light green, and sticky but the stem is long and travels underground for several feet. The roots can be harvested with gloves (they do 1d4 necrotic dame on skin contact) and brewed into a strong tea that grants the drinker double movement for 2d6 minutes. Mining dwarfs often encounter the mushroom and keep vials of the tea on them to aid their escape from cave ins or flooding tunnels, but more often they use is to exploit a newly discovered vein of ore as fast as possible before others learn of it. The Drow also use it to kill things faster.",
    "Limus Botelium": "This mushroom is small, green, and slimy to the touch and is is often called Slimy Doom.

    "Wizard's Eye": "In the caves of the iron coast grows a mushroom many call the Wizard's Eye. They can be found in the caves by following their reddish glow to the nooks and crannies they propagate in. The mushroom itself is a small round ball that is reddish brown and translucent. Cooked in stew they are tasty and non-reactive but when used in conjunction with a fresh eyeball from any form of humanoid they transform into a useful item called a Wizard's Eye. Placing the mushroom and the fresh eye in a jar together triggers the mushroom to extrude small filaments into the eye and begin to absorb it. Anyone who eats a tendril can see what the new \"Wizard's Eye\"sees for 1d12 hours. They are often placed near dungeon doors, in trees, and stuck to ceilings with putty. The Theives Guild has been known to pay 100gp for specimens as they seem to have no shortage of eyes to use them with.",

This knotted cluster of sponge-like material exudes an inky black liquid when squeezed, and lesser fey purposefully avoid areas in which they grow.
